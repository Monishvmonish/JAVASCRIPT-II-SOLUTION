// In previous assignment you have created a tabular data using javascript. 
// Let’s modify that. Create a form which takes student’s details and show each student 
// detail in table. Each row of table must contain a delete button and an edit button. 
// On click on delete button entire row should be deleted. On click on edit button, 
// a hidden form will appear with the values of that row.
